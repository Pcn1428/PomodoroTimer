# PomodoroTimer

Based on the Pomodoro Technque to promote productivity. 
Any particular work session is broken down into 25 minutes of work separated by 5 minutes breaks.
After four Pomodoros a long break occurs for between 15-20 minutes.

This timer allows users to set how long they want their productive period, short break, and long break to be.
In addition, it allows the users to set the number of cycles (or Pomodoros) that they wish to work for.
